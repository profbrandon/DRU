# Directory Rundown Utility (DRU)

DRU is a utility written in Haskell to give anyone with a
computer a simple tool to get statistics on their projects.


# Installation


# Usage


# Status

Presently, this is a new project that I am just starting.
Once there is more code in this project, I will update this
README.

criticism is greatly appreciated!)


# Roadmap 

The first step is to get a design framework up and running
that way new features will require less effort to add. After
this, the first few features I am planning to add are:
    * Defining categories
    * File counting
    * File size listing
    * File type listing
